# What is it ?

A library to remove the pain for when you have to traverse the filesystem with constraints.

It has been thought as a helper: every feature you could ask for could not be implemented,
so a plugin architecture is at the heart of the project so you can easily add the features you need, such as node filtering, outputting to a specific format, depth limiting, and so on...

A few filters have already been implemented for your convenience (and my needs :p). See the `lib/filters` for an example.
